# <a name="about" href="#about"> About us ‍</a>

etki Tech Network is an online community of Turkish-speaking technologists in Europe. To describe it amusingly and genuinely, we are grassroots, ideology-free, bloat-free, organic and 100% independent.

Founded in 2016, we started as a local meetup group for exchanging and networking among Turkish-speaking and international tech people in Germany.

Currently, etki Tech Network is an international online community built for cooperation and exchange between Turkish-speaking tech experts with migration backgrounds, also including international technologists. Our mission is to enable and drive exchange, diversity and inclusion in the technology scene.

## <a name="etki_JS" href="#etki_JS">‍💻 etki_JS Remote Code Camp</a>

etki_JS Remote Code Camp is an online program to study, learn and dive deep into modern web development, which is organized by etki Tech Network community together with [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) and [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/en).

As technology stack the students learn the most relevant and up-to-date technologies for modern web development, including Javascript, React, Node.JS, MongoDB, Express and GraphQL. 

In the etki_JS course we run regular co-learning workshops for supporting the students' solo-learning efforts on the structured course material we have selected, in which students can ask their questions on the material to experienced software engineers, or discuss, co-study with their peers.

etki_JS courses are self-paced, 100% free of charges, and will run fully remote.

Both intermediate developers who want to dive deep into web development and beginner students are well-served with our selection of learning material.

Our course is planned to be on-going. Duration of the learning program will depend on the individual student's knowledge level and their pace.

As course material we follow the open-source programs of University of Helsinki's FullStackOpen, and other high quality learning materials from FreeCodeCamp and Javascript.info. If students follow all the course material of ~100 hours diligently to finish the FullStackOpen program and deliver the course projects on top, they will be presented with an official completion certification from University of Helsinki. 

Our mentors are English or Turkish speakers, students who speak English or Turkish are welcome. Main goal of this course is to provide a free and safe online learning environment for the underrepresented or underprivileged people in technology, and for the people who are looking into transitioning into the technology area.
